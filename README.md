# AI-Powered Lead Outreach & Voice Agent Automation

This repository showcases production-grade n8n workflows I designed and built for scalable lead outreach, personalization, and AI voice agent deployment.

The systems are used to automate:
- Lead enrichment and email validation
- Personalized cold email injection into outbound platforms
- AI-powered voice agent creation for local services and restaurants
- Knowledge base generation and assistant provisioning
- Metadata tracking and follow-up automation

These workflows are modular, secure, and built to operate at scale.
